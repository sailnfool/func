# dotests - run a series of scripts to test the bash functions in
#           the tests subdirectory which should have a 1-1
#           correspondence to the bash functions in the scripts
#           directory.  Note that each of the test scripts must contain
#           the "nametext" string to be able to announce the teste
#           which is being run.  The test functions exit with either
#           an exit value of 1 <FAIL> or 0 <PASS>
#
#           One of the tests has a -v option (verbose) option.  It 
#           would be good to add this as a parameter to this master 
#           script, but then all of the tests would have to be -v aware
#           which will take a bit of work to not only add it but to
#           verify that it is supported in a testing script and not
#           produce excess output if it does not.
